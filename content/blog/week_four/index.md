# Part One: Individual Accomplishments
## Summary

For our fourth week in labs, we began to shift focus away from the core functionality of the site and towards the UI/UX and design of the site. Of course, as we continued to refine the look and feel of the site, we also still worked on the functionality, and we found that we still had quite a few tweaks to make to the back end to make sure the front end was receiving the correct data in the correct shape.

Although I did some work on the UI/UX, I have to give most of the credit to my teammates for really giving the site the look and feel that it developed over the week. I found myself spending more time on fixing or adding functionalities to the site--mostly ensuring that new class data was being saved to the database after coming back from SendGrid and working on the edit class functionality.
