# Part One - Individual Accomplishments
## Summary
In our second week in Lambda Labs, the team focused on getting the API's running, finalizing our database models and the connection between the front and back end, and implementing Auth0 for authentication.

Auth0 was probably the biggest challenge of the week, and I spent a lot of time working on that early in the week. On Monday and Tuesday, Sawyer, Chaya, and I walked through the examples on the Auth0 site and got the basic login functionality working. I also wrote some tests for some of the endpoints on the backend.

On Wednesday and Thursday, I split time between working on Auth0 and helping Tim to create the class create/edit form in a way that made sense with our SendGrid implementation. I also spent a bit of time writing some basic documentation for our API's endpoints.
